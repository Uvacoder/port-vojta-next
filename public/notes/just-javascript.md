- very UIish
- each block
	-   how is it presented
	-   how does it compose 
		-   how does holes look
		-   how does unparsed holes look
	-   how does completion looks like
	-   how does completion propagates
	-   lights? (ableton?)
	-   icons
- the result should look still similar
	- but different enough at the same time
