embeds look like this `![[]]`
- maybe I could recognize different types like video, image (done), and others?

highlights look like this `====`
- is ==this a highlight==

collapsable lists with toggles?

comments look like this `%%%%`
- is %%this a comment?%%

**tags**
- this is a tag #starred 

**block references**
- this is a block reference [[tools#^d46631]]

**linked mentions / backlinks**
- difficult, probably not a job for remark since I need to go through all of the notes
