### to dos
- technicalities
	- create bundle on backend
		- I've been using pure react bundle in dev for testing purposes: https://github.com/eggheadio/kcdbundle.com/blob/main/data/bundles.development.json we use it to interconnect product with the site
	- enable commerce in staging/production
		- we have a script to fetch data from egghead and cache them as json: https://github.com/eggheadio/kcdbundle.com/blob/main/data/cache-json-data.js bundle is just a playlist with price
	- likely more given nature of this project that I'm unaware of
- design
	- replace lorem ipsum with actual copy
	- make sure the message is clear
		- normally $599 —> in bundle for $299, etc.
	- marketing?
	- /thanks page needs to be different —> describe next steps
		- assuming they get two emails which will log them in into each product?
