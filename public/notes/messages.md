> Hey X :wave: We’ve starting to think about the visual branding and art direction for this project. Would you be up for putting together a mood board to help guide the visual style on this?It can include illustration styles you like, websites, graphic design styles, typography, colours, etc. Anything you have strong inclinations towards. We’ll use it to guide any internal design work we do on the project, as well as to search for an illustrator who can help make visual assets.I’d recommend using either Miro or Pinterest to collect images and pop us a link. Or whatever app you prefer.
